Eddie Izzard is already pretty random. So why not make him more so.

This Python project takes a simple txt file of his show "Dress To Kill" -- origin of delightful classics such as "cake or death" and "do you have a flag" -- randomizes it, pulling out chunks of roughly 140 characters to feed to the Twitter machine. 

Often it's still funny. He's that good.

And yes, part of the joke is he's often compared to Monty Python. Seemed like a natural candidate for a MArkov bot.
