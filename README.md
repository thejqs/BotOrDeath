This Python project takes a simple txt file of his show "Dress To Kill" -- origin of what have become delightful classics: "cake or death" and "do you have a flag" -- randomizes it, pulling out chunks of roughly 140 characters to feed to the Twitter machine. Each tweet gets stashed in a database along with its creation time and the number of characters in the tweet.
