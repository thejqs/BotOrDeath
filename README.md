Eddie Izzard is already pretty random.
======================================
So why not make him more so.

Seemed like a natural candidate for a Markov bot.

This Python project takes a simple txt file of his show "Dress To Kill" -- origin of what have become delightful classics: "cake or death" and "do you have a flag" -- randomizes it, pulling out chunks of roughly 140 characters to feed to the ol' Twitter machine. Each tweet gets stashed in a database along with its creation time and the number of characters in the tweet. Cronjob automation to send out tweets essentially as often as we'd like.

Often enough it's still funny. He's that good.

And yes, part of the joke is having written this in Python as he's often compared to Monty Python. Explaining a joke ruins it, and yet here we are.
